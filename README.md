# Unified-Ticketing-System

Welcome to the Unified Transport Ticketing System repository! This project aims to create a seamless, integrated public transport network by implementing a unified ticketing system, route optimization algorithms, and a user-friendly application. This repository contains code for a Streamlit application that demonstrates key functionalities of the project using mock data.

Project Overview:
 Objective
  * Enhance commuter experience through convenience and real-time information.
  * Promote public transport usage by reducing travel time and improving efficiency.
  * Streamline fare collection processes with "One Ticketing" technology.
 Importance
  * Improves urban mobility by offering convenience, reduced travel time, and optimized transport routes.
    
 Project Scope
  * Integration: Connect electronic ticketing machines and backend systems across Metro Rail Limited (MRL), Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC), Southern Railway, Auto, and Car/Bike services.
  * One Ticketing: Develop infrastructure for seamless payment and fare management.
  * Route Optimization: Implement algorithms and an application for real-time transit information and route planning.
    
 Data Collection and Sources
  Real Data (if available)
  * Transactional data from MRL, MTC, Auto, and Car/Bike services.
  * Geo-spatial data for transport routes, stops, and congestion patterns.
 Toy/Mock Data (if real data is unavailable)
  * Design mock data representing transactional histories, route maps, commuter preferences, and fare structures.
  * Use synthetic data generation techniques for realistic data creation.
    
 Data Preprocessing and Analysis
  * Cleaning and Preprocessing: Prepare transactional data for fare calculations, commuter behavior analysis, and demand forecasting.
  * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify usage patterns, peak travel times, and popular routes.
  * Machine Learning Models:
    * Predicting commuter demand
    * Optimizing fare structures
    * Route planning
      
 System Architecture (Optional)
  * Design and implement a centralized "One Ticketing" system for fare payments and access control.
  * Integrate with electronic ticketing machines, fare gates, and backend servers.
  * Ensure secure data storage and encryption for user information and transactions.
    
 Route Optimization Algorithms
  * Develop algorithms based on real-time traffic data, commuter preferences, and transport schedules.
  * Implement dynamic routing to avoid congestion and reduce travel time.
  * Integrate with "One Ticketing" data for personalized route recommendations.
    
 Application Development
  * Frameworks: Streamlit
  * Key Functionalities:
     * "One Ticketing" Management: Check balance, top-up, view transaction history.
     * Real-time Transit Information: Routes, schedules, delays, and updates.
     * Route Planning & Optimization: Personalized recommendations based on user preferences and traffic conditions.
     * Fare Estimation: Calculate fares for different transport modes and routes.
     * Feedback & Ratings: Collect user feedback and suggestions.
 
 Project Deliverables
   * Functional "One Ticketing" system with secure payment infrastructure.
  * Route optimization algorithms with dynamic route planning capabilities.
  * User-friendly application offering real-time transit information and route planning tools.
  * Report detailing data analysis findings and recommendations for further improvements.
 
 Evaluation and Monitoring (Optional)
  * Monitor KPIs such as ridership increase, average travel time, and user satisfaction.
  * Continuously improve the system based on user feedback and data insights.

  Future Work (Optional)
  * Explore integration with other transportation modes (e.g., cabs, autos) for seamless multimodal travel.
  * Implement real-time passenger information displays at bus stops and train stations.
  * Develop advanced fare pricing models based on time-of-day, congestion levels, and user preferences.
  * Integrate AI chatbots for real-time customer support within the application.
